In to the Hub
=============

This is my first project setup in Git Hun and i want to play with it to know more about Git and the difference if it from SVN.

So far it looks so cool to me.

I want to try this from my local and see the changes are reflecting in the master first. This could be true, if I understand its working correctly.

Thanks,
-Dixon
